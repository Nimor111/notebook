** Note
The Eisenhower matrix for organising your day/week/month
This is based off the idea of prioritisation of tasks - it has four quadrants:
1. Important and urgent tasks - do them right away
2. Important but not urgent tasks - schedule them for later but still so them
3. Not important but urgent - delegate OR automate them somehow
4. Not important and not urgent - annihilate them, time wasters are here
