** Note
Welcome to my stream of notes. Its aim is to have, well, a stream of notes, one (or more) per day. Each note can
be something good that happened that day, something I discovered, the highlight of the day, a citation or
something of the sort. The idea is to focus on one good thing each day and be able to look back at them often,
for motivation and nostalgia.

Inspired by: https://rushsteve1.us/feed, as in "Twitter without the twitter".
