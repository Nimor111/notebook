This is a little overview of the backend frameworks i've seen and tried (a little) in the delightful language known as PureScript.
Two stand out for me ( basically the two I tried ).
* [HTTPure](https://github.com/cprussin/purescript-httpure)

This framework provides cool abstractions for Request, Response, middlewares, routing and different aspects of HTTP. It's a great base to build upon to extract your own libraries and patterns over it. There's a bunch of examples and guides. The maintainer is also a great and helpful person.

There are also some extras ( extensions ) for the framework here: [HTTPure extras](https://github.com/akheron/purescript-httpure-extras).

The cons from my viewpoint is that it's a bit too boilerplate-y.
But the bigger your application gets, the more patterns you can abstract out, you can basically make it however you want it.

And of course, since this is PureScript, you can treat each of these abstractions as javascript objects due to the awesomeness of row types.

* [Payload](https://github.com/hoodunit/purescript-payload)

This framework is a more declarative type. The base of the application is a specification of an API. You write a Spec, everything down to Resources, Routes, Auth guards, Params are a declarative specification. You get stuff like routing and clients for free. ( since, as mentioned, it's a declarative specification ).

And of course, since this is PureScript, you can treat each of these abstractions as javascript objects due to the awesomeness of row types.

There's also a great test suite that can be an example of testing your actual application.

This was a little overview of the two frameworks I liked. I will definitely write more about them.
