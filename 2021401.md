## Components in Halogen

A component in Halogen has the following constructor:

```purescript
component :: forall q i o m. H.Component HH.HTML q i o m
```

Where the type variables are as follows:

* `q` is the `Query` algebra type of the component - external messages which can be sent to the component.
* `i` is the `Input` type of the component, which is passed to it by a parent component. This is akin to `Props` in React.
* `o` is the output `Message` type that the component can send to parent components
* `m` is the underlying monad that the component uses for evaluation - this can be `Effect`, `Aff`, or any application monad that is an instance of `MonadEffect` or `MonadAff`

Other things the component uses:

* `State` - the type of the internal state of the component that it uses for behaviour or appearance modifications
* `Action` - the type of actions that the component sends internally - to change its state for example
* `initialState` - Self-explanatory. This is a function of type `Input -> State`
* `render` - a function of type `State -> H.ComponentHTML Action () m`. This is akin to the `view` function in the Elm architecture.
* `handleAction` - a function that determines how the component state changes depending on the action. This is a function of type `Action -> H.HalogenM`. This is akin to the update in the Elm architecture.
