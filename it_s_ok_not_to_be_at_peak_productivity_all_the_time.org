* It's ok not to be at peak productivity all the time

** Note
Sometimes you just have to kick back and stop obsessing over whether you're progressing your goals, or whether
you're productive. No use forbidding yourself from doing things you love just because you think it makes you more
productive if you don't do them. Life is meant to be enjoyed. Simply relax and do something you know you'll
truly enjoy. For me this is a good night of gaming from time to time.
