** Note
I'm going to learn this language, it's me and the language (as a conversational partner of sorts). Learn a
language for yourself, for your own reasons. Learn the language to pursue your interests instead of just
learning it for the fact, or because it's popular and cool right now.

Set specific goals to refer back to when it gets lonely and hard. Learn to appreciate
[[z:/small_and_big_goal_steps?type=branch]].

Instead of burying yourself in exercises and grammar, just listen, read to content, let it "come in", lookup
grammar, etc. It's more important to let the language sink in without trying to remember everything.

To make learning a language easy and always available, have a "language learning lab" with you all the time,
like the audio of a course on your phone, or audiobooks.
