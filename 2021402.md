PureScript is a compile-to-javascript language that is based on the same ideas Haskell is - a strong type-system, pure functional and a concise, clear way of representing data. It's a very delightful language that can be used for frontend (through browser JS) and backend (through NodeJS). It also generates pretty readable javascript that can be viewed and debugged relatively easily.
