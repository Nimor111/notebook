## Note-taking methods
The video in the references highlighted three main things the author does in terms of note-taking:

* Morning pages:

  The main idea behind morning pages is to act as a sort of brain dump in the morning when you wake up. Your head can quickly fill with thoughts that cause anxiety, worry you and can start your day off bad. So to reduce that anxiety, you can write your thoughts on paper (or virtual paper). You "trap" your thoughts on the paper, in a way. That reduces anxiety and can help start your day off right. Definitely something worth trying. Not keep those thoughts stuck inside. As far as I understood it, it doesn't always have to be something of value, just get it out of there. Recommendation was three pages, but I guess that's not a fixed number.

* Five minute journal:

  The five minute journal is a way to increase focus and help you appreciate the little things.
It revolves around writing the following things every(-ish) day:

  In the morning:

  1. What i'm grateful for (x3)
  2. What I can do to make today good (x3)
  3. Daily affirmations, things like "i'm something, i'm something else". Sounds quite reassuring. (x2)

  In the evening:

  1. Amazing things that happened today (might have to be a bit creative, not the biggest fan of the word amazing) (x3)
  2. How could I have made today better? ( I like this one ) (x2)

* Small journal for (crazy) ideas and interesting goals

  The author gave some pretty interesting ones ( like cut off is legs ). But this one is quite obvious - have a small journal for when the inspiration strikes for ideas and goals that you think of during the day. These should be reviewed - a week after, a quarter after, and underline what sounds interesting. Sounds like a good way to pinpoint my often appearing ideas for projects.
