** Note
The main idea behind morning pages is to act as a sort of brain dump in the morning when you wake up.
Your head can quickly fill with thoughts that cause anxiety, worry you and can start your day off bad. So to
reduce that anxiety, you can write your thoughts on paper (or virtual paper). You "trap" your thoughts on the paper, in a way. That reduces anxiety and can help start your day off right.
Don't keep those thoughts stuck inside. As far as I understood it, it doesn't always have to be something of value, just get it out of there. Recommendation was three pages, but I guess that's not a fixed number.
