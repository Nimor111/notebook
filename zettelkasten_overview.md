This is my simplified understanding of what a Zettelkasten is. Seems like a decent place to start.
1. It's a **note taking** system that focuses on finding and cultivating connections between notes.
2. Every note has connections to other notes that make it part of the **knowledge** web.
3. As it grows, the **Zettelkasten** will become a solid knowledge base that can be searched and "conversed" with, as it were.
4. The structure of a **Zettelkasten** file:
    - Title
    - The note itself
    - Links to other notes
5. Imporant things about **notes**:
    - They should be atomic and standalone - a **note** is only about one thing, and should be **standalone**.
    - A **note** should always be linked with other **notes**. An unconnected note does not contribute to the web.
    - Don't copy paste things, try to write things with your own words so that you can understand them when reading them later.
    - The idea of **Zettelkasten** is to be a knowledge base for years and remind your of ideas you had years ago even if you've forgotten them. It acts as a memory of sorts.
    - Add **references** to notes so you know where they're from.
6. Create **outline notes** that connect similar notes when they naturally arise.
7. Do not delete **notes**. Instead the new ones can show how your thoughts and ideas evolve over time.
8. Naming of **notes**:
   - Descriptive titles make everything much easier to work with. Plain text and future proof means editor-agnostic.
