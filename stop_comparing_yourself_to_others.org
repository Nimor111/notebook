** Note
When you believe something, the brain goes out of its way to justify that belief. It will immediately find
something to affirm it, very powerful. Capture when you're doing this consciously. Repeat to yourself - I am
enough, despite all the reasons your brain can come up with. Stay "in your own lane". You are you, not anyone else.
