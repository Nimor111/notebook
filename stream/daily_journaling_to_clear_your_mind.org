** Note
This is something i've already written about, but I want to reiterate.

The practice of keeping a daily journal and writing in it (at any point during the day) has been invaluable to
my mental health. It enables you to explore your thoughts, find out what you're thinking about on a subconscious
level, or simply vent out something that's haunting you. It's like a conversation with yourself, a listener
that's always there for you. I would encourage everyone to try it.
