* Inherit tags in Org mode

** Note
An aspect of tags in org-mode that I had long overlooked is =inherited tags=. It's a simple idea: when you tag a
heading, all it's children (subheadings) will also receive this tag in addition to their own. The is very useful
when categorizing certain headings in one file. For example I can task different tasks at work with their
general category (meetings for example, or tickets i'm working on) and then tag the specific meeting or task
with its own tags, which provide context.
They are most useful in the org-agenda view.

How this looks in practice:

#+begin_src org
,* Meetings :meeting:
,** Recurring meeting :recurring:
,** One off meeting :one-off:
,* Tasks :task:
,** Frontend task :frontend:
,** Backend task :backend:
#+end_src

#+begin_src org
Recurring meeting :meeting:recurring::
One off meetng :meeting:one-off::
Frontend task :task:frontend::
Backend task :task:frontend::
#+end_src

The flexibility of org-mode to structure data is quite impressive.
