** Note
So this is a semi-serious note, but I've found that when I have a headache, driving can help me with it quite
well - it forces me to focus and in a sense ignore pains in your head. And when I get out of the car, more
often than not, the headache is gone. So that is something to try. It's exploiting the mind's ability to focus
on one thing and push other sensations to the background.
