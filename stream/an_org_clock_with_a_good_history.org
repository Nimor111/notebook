* An org clock with a good history

** Note
Today I discovered an Emacs package called [[https://github.com/unhammer/org-mru-clock/tree/master][org-mru-clock]].

The main feature of the package is aggregating all recent clock entries from agenda files and other org files,
up to a configurable number (=org-mru-clock-how-many= - the docs suggest putting it at 100). It can also be
integrated with ivy completion which provides ivy's search and some cool actions such as jumping to the heading
of the clocked item and so on (with =M-o g= on the entry in the minibuffer).

Since the regular clock history of =org-clock= does not behave very well and is often broken / shows no items at
all, =org-mru-clock= package is a great option for selecting which task to clock into from all your recent
tasks through it's replacement of =org-clock-in= (=org-mru-clock-in=).

An example configuration (with =straight.el=):

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-mru-clock
  :straight t
  :config
  (setq org-mru-clock-how-many 100)
  (setq org-mru-clock-completing-read #'ivy-completing-read))
#+end_src
