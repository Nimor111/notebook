** Note
When you're going through something, it's comforting and relaxing to have someone else relate to it, or for you
to be able to relate to them and their experiences. It helps you realize that you are not alone in this, are
never alone in the world. Other people are experiencing the same, and you can all help each other, however
remotely, get through it together.
