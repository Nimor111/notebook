* There's not enough hours in a day

** Note
Today, and recently, I feel like 24 hours is so not enough to have in a day. We need a much stricter
organization and prioritization system to be able to achieve what we want and be content with ourselves in only
24 hours. And that's factoring in the things we *have* to do. It's hard.
