** Note
Here's a quick and easy solution to have your favourite RSS feeds running as a static github pages website.
https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed

It takes in a file with your feeds, rebuilds them every so often with a GitHub actions cron job, and categorizes
them nicely by day and by feed. Also provides a nice github template to easily start off: https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed-template.

Here's my feed repo https://github.com/Nimor111/feeds and website https://nimor111.github.io/feeds/

It's a nice zero setup solution to having your feeds in one place. Give it a try!
