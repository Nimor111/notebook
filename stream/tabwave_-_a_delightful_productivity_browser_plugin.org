** Note
I recently discovered a nice little browser plugin called [[https://tabwave.vercel.app/][Tabwave]]. It replaces your browser new tab with a
dashboard / todo list / pomodoro timer / notepad style screen. You can add often visited links to it for easy
access, search the web from it (though I haven't yet figured out if it allows another search engine besides
google, as I don't use it), start a pomodoro timer, write down daily tasks and notes in convenient tabs. There's
also a neat feature that generates a random activity for you to do when you're bored. It stores all data in the
local storage of the browser (by word of the author). So it's more of a daily dashboard than anything longer
lasting. But it has a lot of stuff conveniently put in one place. I like it.

The code is not yet open source though, so that's a bit worrisome to me and I wouldn't put anything too personal
in there, but the author has said they would open source it eventually.

Here's a screenshot of it:
