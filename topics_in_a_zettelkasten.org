** Note
Topics make it easy to filter by a specific related group of ideas

An important thing about topics is that they should be related to the context in which you want to stumble upon this note in the future.

Examples of topics:

1. A note with a topic of clusterization rather than the more general machine learning will come in handy when writing about or doing research on clusterization.
2. When writing a note about haskell, tag it with - pure functional programming, strong type system, using types
   to prove stuff at compile time, instead of tagging it with just haskell.
