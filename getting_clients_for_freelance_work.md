# Getting clients for freelance work

* Look among your friends and family or former employer
* Post in social media
* Local businesses
* Don't use a premade template, see what the potential client is about and propose a contribution to them ( new website, social media ) - specific proposal
* Websites and job portals - Traversy media 70+ job find websites - add stuff to portfolio and apply for jobs
    * Good clients don't look for the cheapest developer so that's a bonus
* Network with other freelancers, learn from them
* Discord servers, LinkedIn, etc.
* Content creation - blog!
  * Write not only about programming, business stuff works too, it's even good. How to start online business for example.
* Referrals, testimonials
* Don't be too aggressive, don't spam them and nag them
* Have a portfolio - website with projects and stuff
* Do your absolute best
* Find a niche (not in the beginning though, you take what you get in the start), but then go into some specific field
* Add other services - SEO, Social media, Hosting, Graphic design etc.
