# Strongly-typed System F

* Strongly typed term representations in Coq - paper
* Developing a library for substitutions with de bruijn indices in the STLC so that the details of the substitution operation are abstracted away, and you just give it the expression type of your AST
* The hero and the crown - book about a dragon hunter
* Parametrising the expression type by a list of the types of the variables inside to make it more strongly typed, lambda expression cons-es a type to that list
* This can make checking for closed terms easier - check that you are giving an empty list at the type-level while doing small step reduction
* Haskell - pattern match without possible cases - `case n of {}`
* When you want to get really strongly typed, you hit limits of the ghc type checker that can only be solved by proofs ( haskell is not a proof assistant and you would have to use Coq or Agda, or weaker solutions like `unsafeCoerce` or quickchecking it ). Example for that is the type substitutions when dealing with SystemF (polymorphic types).
* You can use `singletons` to promote functions to the type level
