# Linux

Linux is my favourite operating system and my daily driven on all my home computers. It's free, open source and completely under your own control. All you need to do is have the desire to learn how to control your computer with Linux, the tools are all there and free for you. That is the main reason I enjoy Linux. It is also the best option for server hosting, being lightweight and having all the needed functionalities in its default toolkit.
