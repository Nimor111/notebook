Functional programming is a style of programming that's focused around treating programs as a composition of functions on data. These functions are akin to the ones treated in math - they are pure (given the same input the function always returns the same output). All data is immutable to ensure deterministic results from computations. The program logic is divided into two parts: the `pure` part, which is the pure functions that perform transformations on data that are always deterministic, and the impure part, which are all interactions with the outside world - reading and writing to and from files, console, databases, http requests etc. Those are called side effects.

Examples of functional programming languages include:
