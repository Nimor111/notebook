# Clojure

Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM. It's by far the most advanced of the lisps i've seen. It can make full use of the JVM ecosystem while leveraging the unique features of lisp - code as data, immutable data structures, prefix notation, macros and extensibility as well as a very small language core.
