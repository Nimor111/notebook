Welcome to my Zettelkasten. This is a website to implement the Zettelkasten method for note-taking and eventually turn it into a web of knowledge that can help me write and learn all the better in the future.

The technology used to implement the method is the great [neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron).

As a beginning, you can take a look at the [[[2021503]]] section.
